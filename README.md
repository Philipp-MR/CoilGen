<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

The CoilGen Project is a community-based tool for the generation of coil Layouts within the MRI/NMR environment. It is based on a boundary element method and generates an interconnected non-overlapping wire-tracks on 3D support structures. The focus of this work is post processing.

The user must specify a target field (e.g., bz(x,y,z)=y for a constant gradient in the y-direction) and a surface mesh geometry (e.g., a cylinder defined in an .stl file). The code then generates a coil layout in the form of a non-overlapping, interconnected wire trace to achieve the desired field.

A full description is given in the following publication: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.29294

## pyCoilGen: A Python Implementation
The author has supported the creation of **pyCoilGen**, a translation of this CoilGen Project to Python. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/kev-m/pyCoilGen) and
documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://pycoilgen.readthedocs.io/).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Check the documentation to get started



### Installation

1. Download and extract the file of the CoilGen repository
2. Run one of the examples in the folder "Examples"

The project requires MATLAB and optionally FastHenry2 for calculation of the coil inductance.  The MATLAB version should not be older than 2020A.
